This work presents the development of a Human-Machine Interface (HMI) for controlling a robotic arm, proposing a hardware and software solution with a joystick and graphical interface for simulating movements in real time in a computational environment. The central objective is to enable the repair and improvement of legacy industrial equipment, through a low-cost and open source approach. In addition to providing manual control (via joystick), the interface implements the possibility of automatic adjustments, allowing retrofitting in an accessible and flexible way. Throughout the text, the justification for the project, the methodology used, the practical results and the prospects for large-scale application are discussed.
